```

## 1. Initial Platform Setup

### 1.1 Team Structure Configuration

Before beginning internal pentests, it's crucial to set up your team structure in Strobes. This ensures proper access control and workflow management.

```mermaid

    A[Admin] --> B[Security Lead]
    B --> C[Pentesters]
    B --> D[Reviewers]
    C --> E[Findings Entry]
    D --> F[Quality Check]
    A --> G[Report Access]
    A --> H[Integration Management]
```

Follow these steps to configure your team:

1. Navigate to Settings → User Management
2. Create user groups based on roles:
   - Security Team Leads
   - Internal Pentesters
   - Reviewers
   - Developers
   - Compliance Officers
3. Assign appropriate permissions to each group:
   - Finding creation/editing
   - Report generation
   - Asset management
   - Integration configuration

Each role serves a specific purpose in the pentest workflow. Security leads oversee the entire process, pentesters conduct assessments and document findings, while reviewers ensure quality and consistency of documentation.

### 1.2 Custom Fields Configuration

Strobes allows extensive customization through custom fields. For internal pentests, you'll want to set up specific fields to track internal-specific information.

```mermaid

    B --> F[Environment]
    B --> G[Data Classification]
    
    C --> H[Internal ID]
    C --> I[Compliance Tag]
    C --> J[Fix Priority]
    
    D --> K[Test Type]
    D --> L[Scope Level]
    D --> M[Timeline]
```
